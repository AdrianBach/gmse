## Conservation conflict

- People with strongly held views clash over objectives
- Negative effect on sustainability, biodiversity, and human livelihood


## Background on ConFooBio

Resolving conflicts between food security and biodiversity conservation under uncertainty

<div class = "columns-2">

![](confoobio_sans.png)

- How to solve conflict
- What leads to conflict
- Impact on sustainability

All of the above are characterised by uncertainty

## Game theory: conflict and cooperation

<div class="columns-2">

- Formalisation and study of conflict and cooperation between rational decision-makers
- Broadly encompasses combinatorial games (e.g., tic-tac-toe, chess) and evolutionary invasion analysis (adaptive dynamics)
- Compatibile with agent-based modelling

## Conflict in conservation

Game theory provides a natural framework for addressing issues of cooperation and conflict in conservation.

- Game theory can be used to understand stake-holder decision making ([Kark et al. 2015 *Curr. Opin. Environ. Sustainability* **12**:12-24]()).

- Game-theoretic models can suggest novel management strategies ([Colvan et al. 2011 *Biol. Conserv.* **144**:1246-1253](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2010.10.028); [Tilman et al. 2016 *Theor. Ecol.*](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs12080-016-0318-8)).

- Game theory can consider multiple management objectives simultaneously ([Lee 2012 *Chemosphere* **87**:608-613](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2012.01.014)).

## Point about conflict and games being complex

Nils points out that typical game theory assumes that

- pay-offs are known and fixed
- Actions are clear and always available
- Players behave rationally
- Game rules are known to all
- There is a clear rank order of outcomes




## Genetic algorithms

Show the basic idea
Use the gamesGA package to illustrate it in a game-theoretic context

## One run



## Introduce GMSE

## Geese example

- Use some data from Jeremy's paper?

## Future software development
