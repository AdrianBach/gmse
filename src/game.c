 * This file is a work in progress, which will have all of the necessary
 * functions for running the genetic algorithm. Separate functions will 
 * call the genetic algorithm from R and C (C is default in G-MSE), and this
 * file will link with the user.c file to run a genetic algorithm for each
 * unique individual agent.
