This is the start of a Game-theoretic Management Strategy Evaluation software web-site. This will eventually look much nicer, with a logo and description of how to download and use the software, or run the software on a browser. The software is being developed by [Brad Duthie](http://bradduthie.github.io) as part of the [ConFooBio](https://sti-cs.org/confoobio/) project. This page will be updated as necessary.
