Description: This package integrates game theory and ecological theory to
    construct social-ecological models that simulate the management of
    populations and stakeholder actions. These models build off of a previously 
    developed management strategy evaluation (MSE) framework to simulate all 
    aspects of management: population dynamics, manager observation of 
    populations, manager decision making, and stakeholder responses to 
    management decisions. The newly developed game-theoretic management strategy
    evaluation (GMSE) framework uses genetic algorithms to mimic the decision-
    making process of managers and stakeholders under conditions of change, 
    uncertainty, and conflict.
