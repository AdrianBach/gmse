Description: Integrates game theory and ecological theory to construct 
    social-ecological models that simulate the management of populations and 
    stakeholder actions. These models build off of a previously developed 
    management strategy evaluation (MSE) framework to simulate all aspects of 
    management: population dynamics, manager observation of populations, manager
    decision making, and stakeholder responses to management decisions. The 
    newly developed game-theoretic management strategy evaluation (GMSE) 
    framework uses genetic algorithms to mimic the decision-making process of 
    managers and stakeholders under conditions of change, uncertainty, and 
    conflict.
